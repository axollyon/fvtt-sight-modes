# Sight Modes

In Foundry VTT, all tokens with vision are set up to only have their vision blocked by walls that restrict sight. But what if a character sees with something other than eyes, such as through echolocation? This module adds support for that. For example, a character with echolocation can now instead have their "vision" blocked by walls that restrict sound.
